# C Playground

C is a general purpose programming language useful in writing compilers and operating systems. It is a low level language that allows the programmer to explore his creativity.

The language does not provide any operation to deal with composite objects, nor does it define any storage allocation facility. There is no heap or garbage collection; no input and out facilities; no read and write statements and no builtin file access methods. All of these higher-level mechanisms must be provided by explicitly-called functions. Hence the language retains the philosophy that programmers know what they are doing.

The C Language was created by [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie) between 1972 and 1973 as a successor to the programming language B at [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs) to construct utilities running on Unix.

Having falling in love with its simplicity and efficiency in execution, I'm determined to master this programming language and use it to create solutions to solve the most complex and challenging problems facing humanity.

## Technology
The source files were ran with `betty` for standards compliance and compiled with `-Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89`

## Resources

The codes in this repository are my attempt at the questions in the book co-authored by the creator of the language:
